I am a Computer Science (AI & ML) student with strong project-based experience in Python
development, particularly in building AI and GenAI applications using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and agentic workflows.

My career goal is to grow as a Python Developer, working on AI and machine learning–driven
applications while strengthening system design, model understanding, and real-world AI
deployment skills.
